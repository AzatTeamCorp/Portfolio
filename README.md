We are a team of web developers at [Azat.team](azat.team). We specialize in working with web development agencies and studios as outsourcing assistants. We also work directly with clients and handle long-term projects.

- **Laravel**
- **Vue/React**
- **Yii2**
- **PHP**
- **WordPress**

On the frontend side, we work with Vue, React, Bootstrap5, HTML, CSS, SASS, and LESS.

We have expertise in various industries, including:
- Fintech (P2P lending, etc.)
- EdTech
- Logistics
- Manufacturing

We provide quick project estimates when you send us the Figma/requirements document. We have been operating since 2018.

Our services are reasonably priced because we work in a workshop format, minimizing administrative burdens on technical processes.

Additionally, we are:
- ready to participate in creating the Technical Specification (requirements document)
- willing to represent our team during negotiations with clients
- capable of solving non-standard tasks and evaluating the most optimal project implementation options
- prepared to establish long-term relationships
- able to handle both complex, long-term projects and standard websites and e-commerce platforms.
